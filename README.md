# A table that summarizes the FAIR data sources, infrastructure, and informatics tools for EOS article
In this Github link, we provide a table that summarizes FAIR data repositories. 
This table is for Earth and Space Science Informatics EOS-article. 
To summarize, high-quality data is needed to develop accurate, reliable, and fast Earth system models (ESM). 
This information encompasses field, experimental, space, and metadata sets collected from various campaigns across the world. 
The collected data is standardized, stored, and made open-source for Earth and space science communities. 
This table summarizes popular and FAIR data sources for the development of ESM models. 
The field and metadata are then processed and ingested into the ESM models using a coupled modeling-experimental (ModEx) approach.
